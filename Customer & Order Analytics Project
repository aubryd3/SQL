# Practice using SQLite Studio, connecting a database and using it to run queries.

#1 How many orders were placed in Janurary?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = "iPhone";

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers customer
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON customer.order_id = feb.orderID;

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity) * price AS Total_Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY Product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(Quantity * price) AS average_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE feb.Quantity > 2;
